# movieApp-V2.0

https://kaiseridze.github.io/Movie-App-V2.0/

Working with asynchronous requests in ReactJs.  Styling and basic interface.

___

The API was taken from the site https://kinopoiskapiunofficial.tech/

Which I accessed with the async await function

In this build:
+ Refactor first version on ReactJs
+ Encapsulated components
+ Pagination
+ Favorite list
+ Dynamic loading of movies and their rating in accordance with API changes
+ The search also works (Only the names in it are displayed in Russian, since the words are translated)

~~For example~~: '***Your name***' will be translated like '***Твое имя***'
____

Stack:
